    And the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder"
    And the user opens the public link share tab
    And the user changes the permission of the public link named "Public link" to "upload-write-without-modify"
    And the public accesses the last created public link using the webUI
    Then the option to delete file "lorem-big.txt" should not be available in the webUI

  Scenario: Editing the permission on a existing share from upload-write-without-modify to read-write works correctly
    Given the user has created a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | permission | upload-write-without-modify |
    And the public accesses the last created public link using the webUI
    Then the option to delete file "lorem.txt" should not be available in the webUI
    When the user browses to the files page
    And the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder"
    And the user opens the public link share tab
    And the user changes the permission of the public link named "Public link" to "read-write"
    And the public accesses the last created public link using the webUI
    Then it should be possible to delete file "lorem-big.txt" using the webUI
